        <p>Snake game was first invented by computer programmer Taneli Armanto for the Nokia in 1997.
            Snake was built on the concept game Blockage (1976), a two-player arcade game with similar game mechanics. In 2010, 
            Google published their own version of Snake which introduced more game modes, features, and easter eggs. Over every version however, 
            the goal of the game has the remained the same: eat and grow, but do not crash into yourself or the wall, YEEEEEOWWWWCHHH!!!!! This website aims to focus on Google’s
            version of Snake Game, and the many early iterations of the original snake game and how in its simplicity we can analyze what makes snake so powerful, and a very 
            addicting game that continues to remains a popular and well known game in a world where many old videogames are lost to time.

        <p>The earliest version of Snake goes back to its inclusion as a mobile game on Nokia phones in the early 1990s. What makes this version of Snake, any many other early
            iterations unique, is its extreme simplicity. Before, Snake was even hardly a snake, just a line that the player could control, and consuming objects would make it grow. To this day, however, Snake’s gameplay remains simple and straightforward. Jean Baudrillard’s theory of simulation would argue that the closed-off world that Snake creates is a simulation and is exactly why it is so addictive. Because the goal of the game does not stretch into multiple worlds, 
            chapters, or even sequels, and is governed by a small set of rules, it makes it so that anyone can play, and anyone can fall prey to its repetitive nature. </p>

   <div class="content-text">
       <p> No one is perfect in their first play through; even the professionals and speed runners make the simple mistake of bumping into the wall at some point. To master the game,
           a player must play the game repeatedly and fail repeatedly. What is at stake is survival: Survive by eating fruit and growing longer. The player must maneuver the snakes' own body around itself, becoming constraint as it continues to eat in the little box the snake very well may live in, the irony being, the more the player scores, the greater chance of losing there is. Inevitably, the room becomes too small; the snake collides with the wall or into itself, and the player fails; or maybe not. Since losing is always a guarantee, most players are only playing to outscore themselves. So, is there an ending? Yes, 
           but most players rarely reach the end. Snake Game, which is an endless exploit of what might be considered the tamest example of body horror, ends with the snake filling the entire room.  </p>
       </div>
     <div class="content-text">
         <p>Snake Game does not have a traditional narrative or arc. There is no world building, no characters, only fruit. It starts with simple beginnings, easy rules to follow;
             it may even be therapeutic in its beginnings. However, the player quickly discovers that as they continue to eat, the snake grows, and not the room around it. There are no other objectives, feeding the snake. The second phase of the game is filled with frustration, complexities, and brain teasing, as the player either aims to score higher, or fill the room. 
             The end either offers no resolution with the snake collapsing or offers an underwhelming conclusion: The snake fills the room and nothing else.
