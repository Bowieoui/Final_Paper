        <p>Snake game was first invented by computer programmer Taneli Armanto for the Nokia in 1997.
            Snake was built on the concept game Blockage (1976), a two-player arcade game with similar game mechanics. In 2010, 
            Google published their own version of Snake which introduced more game modes, features, and easter eggs. Over every version however, 
            the goal of the game has the remained the same: eat and grow, but do not crash into yourself or the wall, YEEEEEOWWWWCHHH!!!!! This website aims to focus on Google’s
            version of Snake Game, and the many early iterations of the original snake game and how in its simplicity we can analyze what makes snake so powerful, and a very 
            addicting game that continues to remains a popular and well known game in a world where many old videogames are lost to time.

        <p>The earliest version of Snake goes back to its inclusion as a mobile game on Nokia phones in the early 1990s. What makes this version of Snake, and many other early
            iterations, unique is its extreme simplicity. Before, Snake was hardly even a snake, just a line that the player could control, and consuming objects would make it grow. To this day, however, Snake’s gameplay remains simple and straightforward. Jean Baudrillard’s theory of simulation would argue that the closed-off world that Snake creates is a simulation and is exactly why it is so addictive. Because the goal of the game does not stretch into multiple worlds, 
            chapters, or even sequels, and is governed by a small set of rules, it makes it so that anyone can play, and anyone can fall prey to its repetitive nature. </p>
    </div>
    <div class="content-text">
        <p> No one is perfect in their first play through; even the professionals and speed runners make the simple mistake of bumping into the wall at some point. To master the game, 
            a player must play the game repeatedly and fail repeatedly. What is at stake is survival: Survive by eating fruit and growing longer. The player must maneuver the snakes.'
            own body around itself, becoming constrained as it continues to eat in the little box the snake very well may live in, the irony being, the more the player scores, 
            the greater chance of losing there is. Inevitably, the room becomes too small; the snake collides with the wall or into itself, and the player fails, or maybe not. 
            Since losing is always a guarantee, most players are only playing to outscore themselves. According to Baudrillard’s theory, the Snake does not represent a reality. 
            There is no real snake in a confined area eating away at whatever it can find, but instead its own system, in which all of these features, like the point system, They 
            are there to only drive the player to continuously play and get better; there is no higher meaning, no distractions from the real world, which makes this game so addictive. 
            Depending on what version of the game you play, there may never even be a true conclusion; in fact, most players rarely reach the end. Snake Game, 
            which is an endless exploit of what might be considered the tamest example of body horror, ends with the snake filling the entire room.   </p>
    </div>
    <div class="content-text">
        <p>Snake Game does not have a traditional narrative or arc and has an ambiguous ending. There is no world-building, no characters, only fruit.
            It starts with simple beginnings, easy rules to follow; it may even be therapeutic in its beginnings. However, the player quickly discovers that as they continue to eat,
            the snake grows, and not the room around it. There are no other objectives, except feeding the snake. The second phase of the game is filled with frustration, complexities, and brain-teasing,
            as the player either aims to score higher or fill the room. Playing Snake produces an emotional response from the player during this phase. 
            There is anxiety about whether the brain can keep up with the keys or the opposite, in which the player finds a sense of euphoria as they
            mindlessly hit the keys and watch the snake grow. According to Jacques Lacan’s concept of the mirror stage, the player identifies with the snake. The more the snake consumes, 
            the greater the chance of collapsing. This is a mirror image of the players' sense of self and life. The snake provides the player with control where they do not have it. </p>
    </div>
     <div class="content-text">
         <p>These emotional connections are not only produced by the visual simplicity of the game but also through the simple sound design. For this example, we will focus on Google’s version of the game. 
             There are only a few sounds: sounds attached to the keys: Left, Right, Up, and Down. A sound attached to the objective: eat, and sounds attached to either failing or winning. The frequency at which these sounds play should also be kept in mind. The chimes for when a player switches directions, or eats happen more frequently; these, after the first few times, eventually become ignored. Once they may have provided a dopamine hit but are now relegated to the back of the players' mind after so many playthroughs. Similarly, the sound that plays when the snake collides may initially produce a shocked response, but after a while the player becomes desensitized. Finally, the sound of winning plays the least frequently, never plays. This sound will more than likely produce an exited reation from the player, a sense of success and satisfaction, but if you have a player who has mastered the game, this sound too will eventually become meaningless.
             Also note that this version of Snake Game has no background music, increasing the player’s focus and anxiety once they begin to enter the second phase of the game. </p>

         <p>The end either offers no resolution with the snake collapsing or offers an underwhelming conclusion: The snake fills the room, and nothing else. One could view these two ways: The game is final, or the game is endless. It is endless because after completing the game, the only other option is to start all over. There is no next step, no next level, forced to play the same game all over again. Forced to either collapse under your own weight or fill the room with it. It makes sense why Snake Game is so absorbing; the player is trapped in a meaningless loop. On the other hand, Snake offers an end in the form of not eating itself. What drives the snake is its gluttony, no matter how much it eats, it is not satisfied, but instead of consuming Itself once it reaches the end like the Ouroboros, it finally stops, representing the opposite, offering an end to the player’s frustrations with the game. 
             Like mentioned, the snake gives control to the player where they do not have control, symbolizing their desires. </p>
     </div>
     <div class="content-text">
         <p>In the end, Snake Game is just an example of a video game that does not need any fancy graphics, mechanics, sound design, or storytelling to truly compel a player to play. 
             What drives people to play is the fact that it can be beaten, but truly not beaten.</p>
